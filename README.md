# Mini WebGPT

A minimal implementation of [generative pretrained transformer (GPT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer) for web browsers, written in vanilla JavaScript. This library does not implement any hardware acceleration offered by WebGL or WebAssembly. It is designed for didactic purposes only and is unsuitable for production use.

For production use, consider using [ONNX Web runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/) or [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js).
